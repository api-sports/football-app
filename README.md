### Abstract
 I decided to make the Football app to use the new technologies of Android and improve myself. When I started doing this application, there were technologies that I used for the first time. This situation forced me a lot. I got involved in continuous research and received help from various question and answer platforms. I would like to thank everyone separately. I am sharing this project with you as open source. If you have a chance to review the code structure, don't forget to send your advice to me. When I finished this project, I learned very good experiences. This made me very happy. Now I started to roll up my sleeves to start my next project.

### Project Details
In making this football app, I developed it using the APIs provided in api-football. In the application, we select the 1st leagues of Europe from the settings section. In the home page, we can see the league's standings and goal scorers. From the fixture section, we see the entire fixture of the league. When the fixture is clicked, we can see the statistics of the match and the matches between the teams. On the Team tab, we can see the players of the team and all the transfers it has made.

### How Can I Use
If you want to use this project, all you have to do is 
```
/util/Constant/
API_KEY = "Your API KEY"
```
you can follow this path and use the API you obtained from [api-football](https://www.api-football.com/documentation) or [rapidapi](https://rapidapi.com/).
